# AtonixCorp Platform Security Implementation Checklist

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Data encryption at rest with Fernet
- [x] Secure JWT authentication with rotation
- [x] API key management system
- [x] Rate limiting and brute force protection
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Security middleware implementation
- [x] Real-time security monitoring
- [x] SSL/TLS configuration for HTTPS

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Replace development SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection system (IDS)
- [ ] Implement backup encryption
- [ ] Configure log shipping to SIEM

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Set up email alerts for critical events
- [ ] Configure dashboards for security metrics
- [ ] Implement automated threat response
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning

### Compliance & Auditing
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Create incident response procedures
- [ ] Regular security assessments
- [ ] Penetration testing

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your .env file:
- ENCRYPTION_KEY
- JWT_SECRET_KEY
- API_KEY_SALT
- SECURITY_ALERT_EMAIL

### Database
Run migrations to create security tables:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations security
python manage.py migrate
```

### Redis
Start Redis for caching and rate limiting:
```bash
redis-server
```

## ðŸš¨ Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit .env files** to version control
2. **Rotate encryption keys** regularly
3. **Monitor security logs** daily
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
5. **Use HTTPS in production**
6. **Implement proper access controls**
7. **Regular security audits**

## ðŸ“ž Incident Response

If you detect a security incident:
1. Document the incident
2. Contain the threat
3. Assess the impact
4. Notify stakeholders
5. Implement fixes
6. Post-incident review
